# Homework 2: Operators and Conditional Statements
#
# Name:
####################################################################################################################

# For this homework, please select one of the two mini-projects to complete. I encourage you to do both, but only one
#   is required.

# For each of the mini-projects, be sure to handle error-prone inputs with a `while` loop, like we did in the adventure
#   game. I will be checking for this when we next meet!!

# Mini-Project 1 : Chatbot Extension

# Extend the chatbot program to ask the following questions:
#       1) What is the person's favorite food?
#       2) How is the person feeling?
# For the first question, give the chatbot a favorite food (and see if chatty and the user like the same food). For the
#   second question, have chatty give appropriate responses based on the feeling (you may need a very general `else`
#   statement so chatty doesn't say anything too weird to the user).

# Also this would be a good time to use `time.sleep(...)` to give the chatbot realistic pauses for its responses
#   This will make the chatbot's communications seem more genuine (or more human-like).

# Mini-Project 2 : Cat or Dog age convertor

# Write a python program that allows a user to enter whether the animal is a cat or dog. Then enter the animal's age.
#   Then the program should calculate the animal's age in human years!

# Advice: - For dogs, the 1st year is equivalent to 12 years, the 2nd is 24 years, and every additional year after that
#           corresponds to 4 human years
#         - For cats, the 1st year is equivalent to 15 human years, the 2nd is 24, and every additional year after that
#           corresponds to 4 human years
#         - I suggest the following order for inputs: dog or cat, age of animal, calculate age, print in human years

# Mini-Project 3 : Game Extension

# Extend the game we built before. Alternatively, you can build a completely new game!
# I encourage you to be creative (and add what you think is most fun). Here are some
#   suggestions on what you could add:
#       1) Add more items (and give them a use in the game)
#       2) Add more directions to go in
#       3) Add more text and story elements
#       4) Use the `turtle` library to generate a map if the user chose the map item.
#       5) Have someone ask a riddle to the player
#       6) If the player wins, have `turtle` draw them a happy picture (can also provide one if they lose)

# Advice: - It may be helpful to write out a flowchart to see how to structure the if-then statements
#         - when adding an option, be sure to check all possible paths for that option (to make sure there are
#           no errors!)
