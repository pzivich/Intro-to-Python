# Homework 3: Functions and Random Numbers
#
# Name:
####################################################################################################################

# For this homework, please select one of the three mini-projects to complete

# For each of the mini-projects, be sure to handle error-prone inputs with a `while` loop, like we did in the adventure
#   game. I will be checking for this when we next meet!!

# Advice:
#       - See the documentation for the `random` module at: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

# Mini-Project 1 : Chatbot Extension

# Extend the chatbot program to randomly choose what questions to ask. Change the questions that the chatbot asks into
#   functions. This will be helpful for the random question choices. Randomly determine how many questions the chatbot
#   wants to ask.

# Since the chatbot will only be asking a few different questions, add some more.
# Also re-write the questions as functions. This will make it easier to allow for random selection.

# Mini-Project 2 : Abstract Art

# Use the `turtle` library to generate some abstract art. Have the turtle choose to go in a random direction for a
#   random number of steps. Once that space is reached, have a random shape and a random color be chosen for a new
#   shape. Continue to make shapes for a random number of times.
# The function we wrote to generate specific polygons will be helpful.

# HINT: you can use `random.seed(561)` to have turtle produce the same art every time. Try it with different seed values

##############################################
# Mini-Project 3 : Magic 8-ball

# Create a magic 8-ball. The user types out a question and the magic 8-ball gives a response. Much like a real magic
#   8-ball, the answer provided should be a randomly chosen response from a list of possible options. Have fun making
#   up the response options!
# Be sure to use functions and you should also allow the user to ask another question (i.e., don't exit the script
#   until the user says they have no more questions).

# HINT: random.choice(...) lets you select a random item from a list
